Welcome to my portfolio! As a backend developer with [3 years] of experience, I have contributed to the development of various scalable, responsive, and secure applications and systems. Using the latest technologies and best development principles, I always strive to create efficient and reliable backend solutions.  

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading books. I love the pleasure and excitement of gaining new knowledge other than programming from the books I read.
